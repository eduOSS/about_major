I have **a strong passion for** education and I have taken part in a number of classes that have **implemented git as** a core part of their teaching practices and I really **want to help with** the movement.  

We like to use the /cc **syntax** (an **abbreviation for** carbon copy) to include people in issues.

Issue management is one of the most powerful tools **at** any developerâ€™s **disposal**.
