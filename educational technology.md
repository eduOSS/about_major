* zone of proximal development   
  The notion of “scaffolding,” rooted in the Vygotskian concept of “**zone of proximal development**,” was coined by Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976) and refers to teacher and peer support that enables
learners to attain a higher level of achievement than they would be able to do by themselves.
